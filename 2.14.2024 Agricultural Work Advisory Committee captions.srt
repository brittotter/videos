00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:09,000
Betty Velasquez: [Clears throat] Since this is the first meeting of 2024, 
I think it'd be appropriate for everyone to go around and just

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,028
introduce themselves and who they're with if that's okay. 
We will start with Kiarra.

28
00:01:56,212 --> 00:01:58,440
I think the first order of business we need

29
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,720
Kristina Rosett: sorry we have another CDLE attendee here. Kerri.

30
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,760
Betty Velasquez: Oh I'm sorry, I can't see everyone on

Betty Velasquez: Hey, Kerri nice to see you.

33
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,560
Kerri Owen: Hey, nice see you.

34
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,760
Hunter Knapp: And I believe we have a member of the 
public who just joined on Zoom as well.

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,000
Hunter Knapp: Trent Taylor?

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,400
Betty Velasquez: Trent did you want to introduce yourself?

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,560

40
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,840
Trent Taylor: Thank you.

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,813
Betty: So we do have the agenda up. Uh, the first order of business is the election or the appointment of officers for 2024.

42
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:50,323
We didn't do that at the last meeting. I think 
it's appropriate since it's the first in-person meeting.

43
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:03,514
Jennifer: Well, I I nominate our current chairs to 
continue, our last year's chair is to continue.

44
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:06,829
If I can do both.

45
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:07,945
I second that motion.

46
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:12,719
One at one at a time or what you use your preference?

47
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,188
Betty: We can do one at a time

48
00:03:15,188 --> 00:03:22,633
Daniel: Either. I mean, I I'm more than happy to continue. Also, 
I feel like I dropped the ball a fair amount so,

49
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:29,960
happy to as long as I'm not slowing things down, 
um, more than happy, and been really happy to work with Betty.

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,460
Betty: Yeah.

51
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,269
We make a good team.

52
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:33,940
I think we can do together if you want.

53
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,993
Betty: Is there anybody else that's interested in the chair position?

54
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,273
Don't all jump at once. [Laughter].

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,434
If we have a nomination, do we have a second?

56
00:03:49,434 --> 00:03:50,543
Speaker 5: Hunter I believe second

57
00:03:50,543 --> 00:03:51,838
Betty: Hunter second, okay.

58
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,899
Anyone else?

59
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,446
Then call for your vote.

60
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,499
All in favor?

61
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:09,978
[Many voices] Aye.

62
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:11,238
Betty: Any opposed?

63
00:04:11,237 --> 00:04:19,697
Okay, so Dan and I will co-chair for 2024. 
Again, thank you for your confidence.

64
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:28,280
We need the appointment of the Wages Subcommittee Chair, 
nominations for the Wages Sub Committee Chair.

65
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,282
Kiara: Um, I would like to nominate Jennifer Rodriguez. [Laughter].

66
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,546
Jennifer Rodriguez: Oh thank you.

67
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:51,244
Betty: We have a nomination of Jennifer. I will second that motion. 
Any other and anyone else interested in that chair position?

68
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,808
Okay, hearing none, all in favor?

69
00:04:57,808 --> 00:05:02,522
[Many voices] Aye.

70
00:05:02,522 --> 00:05:04,013
Betty: Okay, any opposed?

71
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:06,173
Okay congratulations, Jennifer.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,967
We now on to appointments of 
the Labor Conditions Sub-committee Chair.

73
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,443
[Background conversation]

74
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,640
Betty: I will nominate Kiara as the [Kiara laughs]

75
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,023
no one's doing it

76
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:36,758
Jennifer: I know, like anyone else?

77
00:05:36,758 --> 00:05:44,576
Betty: Well, I nominated Dan second. Any further discussion 
or any other, anybody else interested in that chair position?

78
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,117
Okay all in favor?

79
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:49,946
[Many voices] Aye.

80
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,406
Betty: Any opposed?

81
00:05:52,406 --> 00:05:55,437
Okay, congratulations, Kiara.

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,127
[Barely audible conversation] We confirmed on Friday and I sent a reminder this morning.

83
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:11,750
Daniel: [Clears throat] Yeah I guess the next thing on here was just to 
kind of go over the have a review of the open meetings laws.

84
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:17,761
I actually don't know if we have anybody 
that's prepared to speak on that or anything at this point.

85
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:25,199
Betty: Kristina, I think you had the open meetings you shared 
that with us the first meeting that we had. Do you have that document handy?

86
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,738
Kristina: Um, not right at my fingertips but I could 
probably find one.

87
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:35,753
Um, the one thing I would emphasize is trying to get stuff 
in the shared Drive for and in advance of the meeting

88
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:38,748
so that the public is able to access um things like the agenda.

89
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:42,123
But yeah, let me look and see if I can find the

90
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:44,565
um resources that we initially shared too.

91
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,449
Betty: Thank you. [Clears throat].

92
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,524
Daniel: Yeah, maybe that goes back 
into the Ag work the procedures discussion too.

93
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:04,758
Maybe we can have to talk a little bit more too, 
for you know, if you and I have deadlines of a week before,

94
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:09,839
or the other chairs have a deadline for the week 
before, or something like that, and we can get it in the drive and

95
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:15,654
because if not I'll wait until I'm driving up here 
at every red stoplight to try to like add

96
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:17,418
Jennifer: that's safe

97
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:20,414
Daniel: Yeah yeah, right? I didn't rec [laughter].

98
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:32,588
Anybody have any other questions at this point? Or maybe we
can bookmark this for another time to discuss a little bit more

99
00:07:32,588 --> 00:07:37,659
I think sunshine laws are always kind 
of tricky to navigate and feel like we're being effective

100
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,900
um, while being compliant

101
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,683
but wanted to provide some space for discussion.

102
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,247
Betty: So for the agenda we we kind of struggled 
with this because of the Sunshine Law um,

103
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:56,643
it's been a little diffic difficult to navigate 
so I guess my question to the group is

104
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:02,042
What would be the pleasures? If we create a draft, send it out to everyone? 
Or have Kristina or somebody send it out?

105
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:05,617
Or Aldo send it out to everyone and people add to it? Or,

106
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:08,164
What would be the best way to navigate the agenda?

107
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:12,885
Kiara: Oh because we can do like a shared Google doc, is that allowed?

108
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:16,190
Betty: I believe so. Kristina, is that allowed if we put it on the shared Drive?

109
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,321
Kristina: Yeah, I mean I again, I can't give 
like specific advice about the law, but

110
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:26,785
that's what I would recommend is to just create a shared 
drive and then as long as again it's in the shared folder,

111
00:08:26,785 --> 00:08:31,609
it's accessible on our website 
and then um can make edits to it.

112
00:08:31,609 --> 00:08:42,423
Hunter: And I want to suggest creating those agenda documents 
in that shared drive there will be a subfolder like this

113
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:48,251
for each of the meetings. So after this meeting, 
I'll create the one for March

114
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:53,410
and then if we create just a shared Google 
doc for the agenda

115
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,758
any communications should be 
contained in that Google doc

116
00:08:57,758 --> 00:09:02,879
and then uh as far as my understanding 
of the open records laws

117
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,968
that will be open to the public the whole time.

118
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:09,176
Betty: so Hunter not to add any 
more to your workload but would it be

119
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:14,876
would it be possible for you to add agendas for the 
month just to create create the doc for

120
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:20,756
the and and then we can just add to it and 
have one each subcommittee as well

121
00:09:20,756 --> 00:09:24,678
Hunter: That is not a problem at all, I can definitely do that.

122
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:25,485
Betty: Would that be easier?

123
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:27,719
Hunter: With sort of a blank template agenda.

124
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:33,355
Jennifer: I think that makes sense. 
I think the only modification I would suggest

125
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:38,520
is something along the lines, 
like it's we put that as like a draft agenda,

126
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:46,051
right, because if everybody can add to it then maybe like at 
some point or at the very beginning of each meeting we like

127
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:52,371
accept it or whatever. Just because, since 
anybody can add it any time, it's like,

128
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:58,120
I don't know I feel like the person who's running the meetings 
should still kind of go over and make sure that it's like

129
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,200
Betty: And it should be adopted, you know? Sounds good. 

130
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:01,710
Kiara: You're right.

131
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,110
Jennifer: And procedurally that should.

132
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,969
Kiara: Well we can set like maybe a deadline like
 this day before the meeting have all your input in

133
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:15,219
so that everyone knows that that's the last day to add and that gives the 
chairs maybe enough time to review and prepare accordingly.

134
00:10:15,219 --> 00:10:19,811
Betty: So procedurally, we will adopt or 
we will um approve the agenda prior to the meeting.

135
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:21,063
Jennifer: Yeah, okay.

136
00:10:21,063 --> 00:10:22,823
Betty: Okay that makes sense.

137
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,801
Jennifer: Prior to the meeting? Or it has to be prior, okay, 
yeah like you said, okay yeah.

138
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:29,320
Daniel: No, that sounds good.

139
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,425
Betty: Thank you, Hunter.

140
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,184
Galen: And I, I, I recall kind of looking 
at open meetings rules.

141
00:10:39,184 --> 00:10:42,195
If it's just on like basic logistics

142
00:10:42,195 --> 00:10:46,268
there can be some member-to-member 
discussion, right?

143
00:10:46,268 --> 00:10:51,814
I think since this will be on a shared doc, if it's open 
to the public there can be some back and forth with comments,

144
00:10:51,814 --> 00:10:55,301
uh in there as well but,

145
00:10:55,301 --> 00:11:00,315
I think we'll still want to kind of strike that 
balance of not having too much um

146
00:11:00,315 --> 00:11:03,942
narrative necessarily within that document as we're

147
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:08,619
looking to to set it and we can always, you know,

148
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:14,774
add to the agenda actually to you know 
at the beginning of the meeting we need to.

149
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,918
Betty: Okay.

150
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,879
Jennifer: Just because we can't see everybody who's on

151
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:27,235
can you let us know someone if um if you do see L will get on okay?

152
00:11:27,235 --> 00:11:29,435
Hunter: Yeah, it'll ask for me to admit

153
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:31,040
Jennifer: Oh okay

154
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:41,124
Daniel: Alright, with that unless there's any further discussion on open 
meetings I'll pass it back to to Betty for the next bullet point

155
00:11:41,124 --> 00:11:47,253
Betty: We wanted to review the the statutes 
but I don't know if that's in are we prepared to do that today.

156
00:11:47,253 --> 00:11:50,680
Or do we want to move on to the let's set the the

157
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,738
the structure of the each subcommittee and 
then we can go back? Or how do you want to do this?

158
00:11:54,738 --> 00:11:57,152
Galen: Sure, yeah. And we can

159
00:11:57,152 --> 00:12:05,618
we should have in the document you know at least 
a a link to the to the bill itself

160
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:10,052
um I don't know how deep you know 
how deep we want to go into

161
00:12:10,052 --> 00:12:15,022
the review of our charge and you know 
the different Provisions in there

162
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:18,241
Betty: I think I'd like to jump ahead to go 
ahead and get the subcommittees set

163
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:23,280
and then we can go into okay what did we cover this 
last year and then really get into the statute and

164
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:24,810
Galen: Okay. That sounds fine.

165
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,361
Betty: So for the wages subcommittee, who would be interested? 
We have our chair.

166
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:30,685
Who would be interested and serving on that committee?

167
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,828
Trent: I will definitely plan 
to serve on the committee and be

168
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:44,088
at those subcommittee meetings every week. 
Are there any other responsibilities attached

169
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:54,813
Jennifer: Oh um well no just I think to go and participate, right?

170
00:12:54,813 --> 00:13:05,344
Um I mean at this point, unless we, does, like, I mean - As 
we go, there might be certain things that people can, you know

171
00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:11,181
take on, like some particular component but at this point, no.

172
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:16,293
Joe: I'll serve on sub-comittee.

173
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:18,555
Betty: Joe? Yeah.

174
00:13:18,555 --> 00:13:22,681
Daniel: I plan on making both of them.

175
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:25,339
Galen: Same here

176
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:26,392
Kiara: I do too

177
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:27,069
[Inaudible]

178
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:28,244
Galen: That was Galen.

179
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:31,185
Jennifer: Well, all of us; Gayen, Betty, and Dan.

180
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,477
Betty: Dan, Kiara.

181
00:13:34,477 --> 00:13:36,119
So that everybody?

182
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:39,570
Jennifer: Pretty much, except for David. What about David?

183
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,511
He's here, right? Yes yeah.

184
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:52,334
David: I'll I'll do what I can. I, my, I'm, I'm really frustrated -
my  time here is likely limited um

185
00:13:52,334 --> 00:14:02,813
I've been drafting a letter uh of resignation slash 
frustration to both the Governor and Kate.

186
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:10,952
Um, really feeling like this is a 
waste of my time uh and um

187
00:14:10,952 --> 00:14:21,572
yeah, I'll I'll leave it at that. But I I'm, I'm still a member 
and I'll I'll be here when I'm here and we'll we'll see how that goes.

188
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,489
Betty: Labor Conditions? Dan do you want to take 
that one? Sub-commmittee members?

189
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:41,999
Kiara: Yeah um anyone interested in signing up for the 
labor conditions subcommittee I think Dan mentioned he'd be on both

190
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:43,702
Galen: Galen said that too.

191
00:14:43,702 --> 00:14:46,715
Jennifer: I'd like to be on it too.

192
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:47,215
Kiara: Galen, Jen. Okay.

193
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:52,880
Anyone else for labor conditions? I think maybe 
Hunter said both but I might have heard wrong.

194
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,502
Hunter: I did yes that's correct.

195
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:55,907
Joe: I'll do it.

196
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:58,688
Kiara: Joe, thank you. Okay.

197
00:14:58,688 --> 00:14:59,679
Betty: I think that's everybody.

198
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,199
Kiara: Dan, Betty, Jennifer, Hunter, and Joe.

199
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,832
Perfect.

200
00:15:04,832 --> 00:15:08,680
Jennifer: Just need to find out for my little I guess.

201
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:09,478
Betty: Yeah

202
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,769
Should we pull up the report and see what 
we ended up with on the recommendations and move forward?

203
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:31,059
Daniel: Yeah. And at some point, I would like to maybe speak a little 
bit to I have a feeling I've had some the same frustrations that David has had

204
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:40,082
um around I'm still a little confused 
of the role of the report and

205
00:15:40,082 --> 00:15:46,526
um the utility of it, and you know 
are there things as a committee we could do to

206
00:15:46,526 --> 00:15:58,292
to make sure that you know the work we put 
in is um is a resource for our uh legislature and such.

207
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:03,359
And we're not just working in our seven 
person backing or whatever we have here.

208
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:05,810
Daniel: And Kristina, you have a hand up.

209
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,581
Kristina: Yeah and not to go off topic, I just 
wanted to let you guys know I had a couple

210
00:16:09,581 --> 00:16:12,770
updates on things you asked for from 
last time and wanted to

211
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:22,263
give a you know an introduction for the folks 
from CDLE that are um new members to this meeting. So

212
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:26,524
um just whenever you want to fit 
me into the agenda um call on me for that.

213
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:29,067
Betty: Now's a good time Kristina just go ahead and jump in.

214
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:43,100
Kristina: Okay um so as I I think I mentioned last time um I'm have um Eric Yohe here. 
He'll be taking on the liaison role while I'm out on maternity leave.

215
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,775
So likely he'll be the face that you see 
the next few months

216
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:52,694
and if there's any like logistical stuff 
that you guys are discussing

217
00:16:52,694 --> 00:16:58,820
you can continue to you know keep me on the 
emails but add him in as well so he can help out.

218
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:09,089
I've given him kind of the background about the like interpreter, 
the posting of the meeting schedule, and our website that kind of stuff

219
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:17,108
so should be good there. I also have Kerri Owen 
here. I invited her after

220
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:23,719
there was an ask last time for kind of follow-up about 
the status of the prevailing practice and wage surveys 

221
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:29,645
and she was able to attend today so I just 
invited her to to speak on that.

222
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:32,503
Another couple things:

223
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:52,092
There was talking talk about the wage calculator that CDA puts together or puts up on their worker 
Services Program website and we worked with them to get a 2024 updated one so

224
00:17:52,092 --> 00:18:00,125
you'll find that on the CDA's website 
on the bottom the link that I

225
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:06,401
just put in the chat title wage calculator.
It's updated for 2024.

226
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:15,867
And hearing kind of the discussion last time we're also working on updating
that calculator so that there's another feature to

227
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:22,247
using your the number of employees you have this 
year versus last year and during different seasons to

228
00:18:22,247 --> 00:18:25,994
determine if you're small or highly seasonal so stay tuned for

229
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:35,432
resource on that. And then the other 
piece was um oh a couple other things:

230
00:18:35,432 --> 00:18:45,965
We also are working on, at your suggestion, a template notice for highly 
seasonal employers to provide to employees so again

231
00:18:45,965 --> 00:19:00,116
more to come. And then finally in the subfolder for the for today's meeting 
you'll find a copy of the translated committee report into Spanish -

232
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:02,710
a PDF and a Word document.

233
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:07,883
So if you have questions on any of those kind of specific things I ran through we can

234
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:16,770
go through them but if there's time for Kerri to to chime in it might be nice to to 
get her so she can get on her way for the rest of the day.

235
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,459
Kerri: Yeah thank you Kristina. So I just wanted 
to give a quick update.

236
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:27,604
I know we talked about surveys and how they've 
been in in works for quite a bit now. So

237
00:19:27,604 --> 00:19:31,642
we finalized the employer practice survey so

238
00:19:31,642 --> 00:19:37,444
I incorporated your guys' suggestions. I know you had, 
Kristina had emailed some suggestions of questions

239
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:39,498
to ask so we incorporated that.

240
00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:44,089
I had sent out the survey to a couple of my 
colleagues at different state agencies just to get

241
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:47,998
who work with Ag employers to get an idea 
of you know how does this look and

242
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:56,638
kind of got on the on the subject of redundancy and duplication. 
So it seems that there are already some surveys out there to

243
00:19:56,638 --> 00:19:59,194
Colorado producers and and Ag employers

244
00:19:59,194 --> 00:20:08,069
so for the sake of redundancy and duplication I discovered I talked to USD and we 
discovered we're allowed to partner with state agencies to conduct these inspections

245
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:11,789
and I know for example let's say CSU extension,

246
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:16,994
they conduct surveys to a Ag employers and
producers and again I know how

247
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:25,355
as an Ag employer or producer having to do surveys in general you
know is just takes a lot of time and then having to do surveys that are

248
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:31,069
the same questions as another survey you just took is you know not 
very highly likely that they're going to complete those surveys.

249
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:40,751
So we're actually now going to pivot and even though we've completed these 
surveys, we're pivoting to work with CSU extension hopefully in a collaboration of

250
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:43,844
just incorporating the surveys that they've already created

251
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:50,552
to include some of the requirements that are needed 
specifically for the H2A questions in the surveys

252
00:20:50,552 --> 00:20:55,500
to disseminate the surveys through CSU. So that's just a very

253
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:02,636
early stage right now. I know that my point of contact is 
gearing up for his conference at the end of the month,

254
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:06,142
that's happening the 28th the CFGA conference, so

255
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:10,369
he's pretty busy so we plan on 
meeting early March to get this going.

256
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:17,156
It just makes more sense to have an agency who has that 
experience that has been doing it consistently

257
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:21,668
to collaborate with CDLE on these surveys

258
00:21:21,668 --> 00:21:30,497
since like I said we don't want to send out multiple surveys to growers and
producers that has the same questions as surveys that just took from a different agency.

259
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:35,172
So we want to eliminate that duplication and redundancy.

260
00:21:35,172 --> 00:21:44,889
But I still plan to include all the suggestions and things that you guys 
you know submitted to include in those surveys that hopefully we're going to collaborate with CSU on.

261
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:47,610
And that's where we're at.

262
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,896
Jennifer: yeah can I ask a question Kerri?

263
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:50,447
Kerri: Of course

264
00:21:50,446 --> 00:21:55,723
Jennifer: Um, so just to clarify, so when you talked about redundancy

265
00:21:55,723 --> 00:22:05,133
so if there's like similar questions in your survey that are 
currently in the the survey that us or CSU extension is doing

266
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:11,309
your you're not taking it out of your survey you're you're just

267
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:15,540
are you combining your survey with the CSU extension survey?

268
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,867
Kerri: Right good question. I think so.

269
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:21,107
Yeah no that's a great question and I 
think that this is

270
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:26,097
very preliminary so I think that's what we're going to 
discuss in March to figure out is it something that

271
00:22:26,097 --> 00:22:32,543
is it going to have the face of CSU extension on on these surveys 
and we're just incorporating our questions into that?

272
00:22:32,543 --> 00:22:39,210
Or, is it just going to be a brand new survey that has you know the 
that's from the Department of Labor but that CSU

273
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,879
extension is helping with? So I'm not quite sure yet. 
Like I said it's very preliminary

274
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:50,869
But so, also, I was made of where too and I just want to make sure - Was there a survey 
created, did this committee create a survey as well?

275
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,485
Or was that a different committee that created a survey?

276
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:58,091
Because I got word that a committee, an Ag committee was also created a survey.

277
00:22:58,091 --> 00:23:03,021
So I just want to also make sure you know somebody else 
is doing things that I'm not overstepping or

278
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:07,444
the the duplication of anything like that wasn't this committee.

279
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:09,564
Betty: The questions we came up with?

280
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:11,216
Jennifer: Right the questions we had for you.

281
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:17,072
Kerri: Oh that's just the question that you - Oh okay okay so maybe that 
maybe they were just they misunderstood

282
00:23:17,072 --> 00:23:21,900
because they telling me that there was a whole other 
survey and I was like well I don't think so

283
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:31,060
Daniel: Kerri, this is Dan Woldvogle, and there is and there is another survey that 
Rocky Mountain Farmers Union with um

284
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,291
the Colorado employee ownership office.

285
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:34,545
Kerri: okay

286
00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:39,278
Daniel: and I believe another partner or so have been working on

287
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:51,435
um uh we've been developing a pilot for an employee owned Cooperative 
um uh for folks that would provide Ag labor

288
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:56,750
and there has been kind of a survey circulating out there for that. Maybe that's

289
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:02,430
I think yeah so as as you as discussions happen in March if there's ways that we can

290
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,426
get any of that important information answered through a single 
survey we'd be more than happy to 

291
00:24:06,426 --> 00:24:07,711
Kerri: I I think that's best

292
00:24:07,711 --> 00:24:10,002
Daniel: I ownership office but yeah.

293
00:24:10,002 --> 00:24:16,000
Kerri: Yeah I think that if we have you know again the capacity in 
which you guys can work with different state agencies 

294
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
like I just found out that you know Department of Labor 
can work with other state agencies to to implement these surveys 

295
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:29,000
so I mean again for the sake of not sending duplicates to to 
to producers and having them answer a bunch of questions 

296
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
if we could create a survey that is is you know centralized that'd be great but 

297
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
at least for the H2A program requirements of having to do these surveys 

298
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:48,000
that is our next step is is actually going to Pivot and see if we 
can work with CSU who already again has the experience, already has 

299
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:59,000
kind of a process for for creating and and implementing these surveys. So, again March 
beginning of March that's what we're looking at to to get that processing.

300
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Jennifer: I, thank you, I I was just trying to confirm, because I know your- 
the mandate for the survey, I think it goes beyond the H2A program right, for the state 

301
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
to do these prevailing wage surveys, um but want to make sure 
that the whatever mandate that you all have to do it 

302
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:22,000
like, if you're if even if you're combining it with the CSU extension one, 
that it's still going to be in compliance with the  

303
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Kerri: Absolutely, yeah. So yeah we have yeah we have to have like 
certain questions and things, you know. I mean the prevailing 

304
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,000
the employer practice survey is pretty open it's flexible to include 
whatever you know we just we just want to we have to make it 

305
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:46,000
relate to the H2A program, right? So subsistancesubsistence, reimbursement, travel reimbursement, 
that kind of thing. You know, do you provide that? What are what is your 

306
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
kind of practice surveys as an Ag employer so we can effectively see how the h2a program should be ran, right?

307
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Um the the pra, the wage surveys are more specific, you know, they do definitely have those specific questions that we have to 

308
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:08,000
abide by, but the employer practice survey is pretty open. But the only from my I mean the only 

309
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
mandate that I get it from is through the H2A program. You know, it's through my 
foreign labor certification grant that tells me I need to do the surveys. 

310
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So I don't know if it's listed anywhere else. It might be, but specifically for the H2A program 
it's part of that forign labor certification program that we do the surveys. 

311
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Jennifer: Got it. So it's the the prevailing practice survey that's going to be done at 
the beginning of March, and the wage survey is different timeline. 

312
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Kerri: Well, so I I I want to talk about both I want to see if if CSU can do 
both, I mean might as well right if if if they're willing to do these surveys 

313
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Um so I the conversation in March is going to be surrounded for both. 

314
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
would be both the employer practice survey and the Wage survey.

315
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:58,000 
Joe: There is a small questionnaire that might be presented at our Colorado 
Fruit and Vegetable Association Annual Meeting, it'll be interactive. 

316
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So it kind of be an in-person thing only done at the meeting itself um. 

317
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's just for producers only and how the laws affected our operations and so forth, but that's 
all it focuses on. It doesn't really focus on any of the points that you just mentioned so. 

318
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It was put together by this committee 

319
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Kerri: Okay and so so those are the questions that we were talking about that you guys had 
suggested to incorporate into the Sur into the survey that I was creating correct?

320
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Or is that completely different a different survey? 

321
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Jennifer: I think he's talking about a different survey. 

322
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
The one that he's doing it, the one that they're doing at their conference?

323
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Kerri: Oh did you say it was it was created by this committee though, Joe? Sorry.

324
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Joe: Well, I thought it was. Yeah it was just a 
short list of questions that was passed by us. 

325
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Jennifer: Right, oh you're right right right. The same questions we sent to you.

326
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Kerri: Yeah and I I okay yeah I mean, I I can't you know if if anybody 
else wants to create surveys different agencies I mean that's 

327
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
you know that that's fine, but I you know this is just specifically for 
the H2A program that I'm hopefully we'll work with Adrian Card on.  

328
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I mean he's the one

329
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,520
Joe: Yeah Adrian will be doing this yeah okay 
question and answer on that short  

330
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,000
one it's not I don't think.

331
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,560
Kerri: Okay. So maybe we can include that if if if that's already being  

332
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:27,120
implemented in the data that we get. But yeah, 
so this is all this is all like preliminary like  

333
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,200
I said. I'm meeting with Adrian at the beginning 
of March to go over this process of collaborating  

334
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:39,920
with CDLE and CSU on these surveys, but the whole 
point is to you know not duplicate in in in these  

335
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,440
surveys you know to make sure that the producers 
aren't getting overwhelmed with the same kind of  

336
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:50,000
questions and the same kind of surveys. So 
hopefully we can streamline it that's the goal.

337
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:00,360
Daniel: Yeah I think the overall question too is 
just how do we actually get trusted information  

338
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:07,000
from Ag workers is the biggest riddle, so I mean 
maybe that's another area of focus that we can  

339
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,960
continue to explore this coming year or too of 
how do we build the cannon for how we can agree  

340
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,720
on what we accept as far as you know really being 
able to truly hear the worker voice is I think the  

341
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,000
biggest goal here. 

342
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:28,120
Jennifer: Well then to get to get it out 
to all workers right to the yeah to not the the  

343
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,000
small percentage of just H2A workers,

344
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Daniel: or potentially coerced or whatever it 

345
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Jennifer: Right to just have it more broad. 

346
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,280
Kerri: Well yeah so the employer practice survey 
and the and the prevailing wage surveys are not  

347
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,880
for workers they're for the employers and it's 
for all Ag employers because they're trying to  

348
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,840
see how does normal Ag compare to the H2A
program, right? And are they similar and is the  

349
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:58,920
H2A program running effectively compared to just 
non H2A Ag work? So that that's the focus of of of  

350
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:04,880
of the goals of or sorry of the surveys through 
the H2A program. So I don't know if if that's in  

351
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,00
line because it doesn't go to workers, it just 
goes to employers. 

352
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,040
Daniel: Yeah along that line, Kerri, just  

353
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,480
for my information do it does the prevailing 
wage survey and other information you gather  

354
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,800
does that help inform the the adverse effect wage rate? 
Kerri: absolutely 
Daniel: Yeah so that's is that  

355
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,000
part of this one and the same or is it? Okay 

356
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,440
Kerri: No that's exactly it so part of that those those  

357
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,400
the prevailing wage surveys is to help determine 
the appropriate aare for for Colorado or for other  

358
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:42,000
states. So, but the thing is is that we have to 
have enough responses for it to matter like if  

359
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,840
we only receive two responses I I wouldn't even 
be able to submit them it wouldn't be enough data  

360
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:53,640
to for them to look into that so I mean that's 
why streamlining it and not duplicating you know  

361
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,200
these surveys to hopefully get these employers 
to respond you know to to a survey is key but  

362
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,880
yeah it does it does it absolutely impacts how 
the H2A program is is run. including the program  

363
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,560
requirements of what you know the employer has to 
do with reimbursement, um travel and then the the  

364
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:16,480
wage. So it's it's key these these surveys are 
key for over Ag um employers for especially for  

365
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,000
H2A program but 

366
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,560
Daniel: So what I'm hearing is that in 
order to get more responses and have less survey  

367
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:36,280
fatigue your hope is to kind of combine a few of 
these different surveys to have one concise clear  

368
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,400
way to really try to get as much information 
as possible. This survey, let's say may have 20  

369
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:49,600
Questions. 10 may just have to do with you know the 
essential questions you need for H2A, I'm assuming  

370
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:57,320
that the other 10 cannot inform what you need out 
of H2A because those questions are pre-ordained as  

371
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:05,680
far as what affects adverse wage rate a-word. Because the 
reason why I ask is I know there's been a lot of  

372
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:13,880
discussion of how do we reform the a-word survey so 
it's more accurate when it comes to you know job  

373
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,800
classifications and other things especially for 
a state like Colorado where if you have a small  

374
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:24,880
crew you might have folks doing a lot of different, 
everybody's a skilled worker, but you might have  

375
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,800
folks doing different skills all in kind of 
the same smaller group. Does that make sense  

376
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,000
as a question? 

377
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:36,760
Kerri: Yeah and um so and again I I can't 
answer that fully I just because I haven't had the  

378
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,840
conversation yet with with CSU to figure out, but 
I mean the idea would be to streamline, I mean that  

379
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:48,320
is the idea to. Now I don't know if incorporating 
other agencies surveys onto this one surveys is  

380
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,520
the route that we would go, or if it just would 
be a separate like this is CDLE's you know survey  

381
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,400
because this is specifically for the program 
requirements that I'm just collaborating with CSU  

382
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:04,280
to do it through. Um so I don't know yet, but but 
that that's something that I will keep in mind and  

383
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:09,000
bring up on what makes sense um going forward with 
with the surveys.

384
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,080
Daniel: Okay so yeah I I guess what I'm  

385
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:19,280
trying to drill down to is your questions are your 
questions and those are what inform your specific  

342
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:25,240
yes H2A needs if we are adding other questions 
that's just to get broader information in general  

343
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:33,840
for I would back the a right I would incorporate 
that into my data to send a USDOL right if it's  

344
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:41,080
not relevant to the specific questions pertaining 
to like H2A and how it affects the H2A program I  

345
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,960
mean it could be included but it's not going to 
be it's not going to be anything on data that I  

346
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,880
would submit to USDOL it would just be the specific 
questions that we have regarding h2a and AG yeah  

347
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,720
perect can you share the timeline I guess as far 
as so if it's completed in March like what is the  

348
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,480
like when does it go out and then when do you need 
have responses by and then when is the information  

349
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,640
so USL doesn't really require like specific time 
frames like oh you have to have surveys done by  

350
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:14,680
this time it's just throughout you know the 
year when you can get them done get them done  

351
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:22,840
um so ideally I would like to have everything at 
least implemented in survey sent out by July one  

352
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:30,080
um that would be ideal to to have to have that 
at least completed and sent out by July one and  

353
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,360
again I don't know the process this is something 
that's extremely new I don't know how long that  

354
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,760
takes and if we are working with CSU what you 
know their availability and things look like um  

355
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,640
but ideally that is the the time frame we're 
looking at how are they going to be sent out  

356
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:51,240
is it going to be electronic or paper or you know 
sometimes those mail official mail type of ballot  

357
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:57,240
you know you get it seems like you'll get farmers 
and producers to respond better when it's looking  

358
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:03,560
more official in a paper form I know it's more 
expensive but that's a great question I think  

359
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,800
that's something we'd look at um I you know I'd 
want to I'd want to get experience of people who  

360
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,400
who work with people completed surveys of of what 
is the most yeah popular way that producers would  

361
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,720
respond if that is electronically or if it's 
physical I mean I don't see why we couldn't do  

362
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,960
both oh it's just yeah both would be good it's 
just you I'm sure David could attest to this  

363
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:33,680
emails we get so many right to 100 a day and we're 
skipping through them and junking so many that it  

364
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:41,840
especially July 1 you tend to pass them over so 
do so does our administrators so um when you get  

365
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:47,600
a paper one you almost feel like you're obligated 
to do it okay that's great feedback thank you

366
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:58,040
Joe that's all I had if anybody doesn't if there's  

367
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:03,240
any other questions thank 
you Kerri yeah thank than

368
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:19,800
K so how do you all feel about going back up 
to the subcommittee structure and the areas of  

369
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,120
focus possibly pulling up the report and with 
the recommendations we said you start talking  

370
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:32,880
about the recommendations for 2024 some of 
the topics that we wanted to tackle in 2024  

371
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,880
uh Hunter can you pull up the final report and 
the record with the recommendations if that's  

372
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:44,880
the way the group wants to go at this point 
yeah I mean if if possible I might like to  

373
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,560
talk a little bit about the report itself 
yeah before we talk about next steps with  

374
00:36:50,560 --> 00:37:02,360
it you know pulling up the statute you 
know it says that we are to um where is

375
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:09,360
it you know by January 1 the advisory 
committee shall report its progress  

376
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:15,240
findings and legislative recommendations 
to you know the two committees and I know  

377
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,440
we're technically doing that by emailing 
it to the two committees but I will say  

378
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:27,520
that with the rush of the legislative 
session um it's been my impression that

379
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:35,720
this isn't necessarily taking up a you know this 
it's not necessarily making the splash maybe that  

380
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,920
we would like I get I think or at least that 
I would potentially like as as contributing to  

381
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:48,920
this and I wonder if it makes sense for us to 
request a a hearing to actually report things  

382
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:59,040
or if we want to even though maybe we deliver it 
in January maybe we invite the Committees to an  

383
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:07,080
inperson meeting somewhere in the state you know 
on a farmer ranch with a workers and and other  

384
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,960
employers and stuff in June or something after 
the session I I'd love to just kind of explore  

385
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:18,720
a little bit of what our utility is and if do we 
have control to kind of determine how we want to  

386
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:25,440
report this out and and stuff because I think 
if we're doing this work we do want to inform  

387
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,800
the legislature and the administration and uh uh 
and including our you know our Regulators as well  

388
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:40,040
you know the I think this type of work is really 
valuable for Ru making and everything else so I'd  

389
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:45,400
maybe like to just invite a little bit of time for 
discussion there if we want to talk any more about

390
00:38:45,400 --> 00:39:04,120
that Dan my my take and and you were ready tell 
me to shut up whenever you want uh's that I'm  

391
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:15,000
kidding is uh the the way the bill was written 
uh we had a business in uh whatever it was called  

392
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:24,160
committee tell uh essentially the Senate and AD 
committee we're going to we're going to do this  

393
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,240
and they're going to report not back to us we're 
the ones who care enough to write the legislation  

394
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:37,800
but we don't care enough to check back in in 
the future somehow they deemed it useful to  

395
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:50,280
form a a group um but have them then report so 
uh we've got Senate uh and house ad committees  

396
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:57,480
that didn't even ask for us to exist to begin 
with who were required to write a report to um  

397
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:05,880
um I don't know I'm I've learned a lot about 
politics since Senate Bill 2187 um and and how  

398
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:15,160
our government functions but I've I've been 
thinking a lot lately that um we we've come  

399
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:26,040
we've uh got together and and uh spent a lot of 
time and we produced something pretty useless  

400
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:38,760
in many ways from a lot of standpoints uh anyway 
uh and then we put that out and from what I know  

401
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:51,320
uh through hearsay but um the the a committees 
um have have no uh awareness of his existence  

402
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,640
um I've I've spoken with legislators who said 
they wanted to talk more with me who said they  

403
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:04,160
really care um legislatur who were part of 
the sponsorship of the bill and yet there's  

404
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:16,680
no engagement there's been um very very little 
use gotten from what we provided um and I you  

405
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,280
know looking at a different perspective which 
I still don't understand well but the governor  

406
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:30,000
ultimately signed the bill and said Yep this 
is useful for us and we have have cdle and CDA  

407
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:40,600
staff and public funds going to to this committee 
and I I really feel that we're all as a society  

408
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:49,720
we're wasting our own time but we're wasting 
taxpayer dollars having uh Aldo and Christina  

409
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:58,680
and Eric Etc support us when when ultimately we're 
we're just kind of dead in the water and it's uh  

410
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:07,240
I don't know how we change it I don't know what 
we do but it it is extremely frustrating to sit  

411
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:16,200
here um and uh and and feel like just it 
it's an absolute waste of time with zero

412
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:24,680
Effectiveness well I was wondering if we 
couldn't go I was wondering why didn't two  

413
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,200
or three of us get together or where we 
requested to go and deliver the report in  

414
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,000
person and that way we could be there during 
the ACT Committee hearing and be available for  

415
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:43,360
question and answer at least you know maybe 
one producer one employee two or three of of  

416
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:49,320
the rest of us uh go there in person and be 
there and one of us deliver the the report  

417
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,440
in person that way question and answer 
from the egg committee or whoever else  

418
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,120
might be there could we could do that it 
seems to be more effective that way in the

419
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:06,640
Deliverance yeah I think that's an option 
this goes to four committees it goes to  

420
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,440
the ab Committee in both Chambers and it goes 
to business labor and Tech Committee in both  

421
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,680
Chambers so it would need to be kind of like 
what when they have Smart act hearings where  

422
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:21,720
they have you know a number of committees together 
I don't think it's out of the question to request  

423
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:32,560
a special hearing to discuss a labor in Colorado 
um and I think either the chairs you know the two  

424
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,280
chairs and the two subcommittee chairs could 
present the full committee could present I do  

425
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,440
think it could get a little challenging if all 
of a sudden they're putting together a number  

426
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:49,160
of experts and bringing in people and really 
politicizing things but at the same time I do  

427
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,400
think personally I think it's valuable to to 
have these discussions as we move forward to  

428
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,000
evaluate what's working and what's not what needs 
to be changed I think that was kind of the goal  

429
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:08,440
of this committee um originally was to provide 
ongoing recommendations and findings um so it's  

430
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,720
I don't think it's out of the question I just I 
think there's maybe some pitfalls to avoid too  

431
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:18,280
right and maybe that's a summer you know maybe 
that's scheduled as an interim summer committee  

432
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:24,520
but then that then all the people involved 
in ager a little busy that time here too but  

433
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:32,320
yeah I mean I I guess I have questions about how 
how we do that I guess how that would be done it  

434
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,760
would have to be formal because it would have 
to be as a committee or speaking on behalf of  

435
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:46,480
the committee not as an individual yeah exactly 
and so everybody comes here with their own ideas  

436
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,920
or you know agendas or thoughts or opinions and 
stuff and so if we were going to be presenting  

437
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:58,120
to any of those committees on behalf of this 
yeah I think it would just be tricky and how  

438
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,280
how that would be done but I imagine there's some 
kind of protocol right when they do want to hear  

439
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:09,400
from committees I just maybe you're more familiar 
with that that no it's a good point and I there's  

440
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,920
got to be something you like take a look at 
the Colorado River drought task force they  

441
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,720
met all summer long they made recommendations 
I'm pretty sure they had a hearing on it if I  

442
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,720
recall did they yeah see I'm just not familiar 
with what the options are so that's something  

443
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,560
we can explore because I agree that like we want 
to avoid splintering off and all kind of because  

444
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:37,000
I could I could take the this report down right 
now and totally Advocate based on my organization  

445
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,480
and that's not going to do the committee a favor 
that's going to be our agenda you know so I think  

446
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,400
there's got to yeah that's why I thought maybe a 
mix of us it would be more effective because you  

447
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:54,040
know when we're all there together we're there as 
a committee and it's more about uh in that sense  

448
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:59,640
us working together and instead of us working as 
individuals and for our own companies we're doing  

449
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:07,200
our job that we accepted to do and this committee 
um so for me it's different you know if I was  

450
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:15,320
there with with with with Dan and Jennifer and 
and and Hunter and we were there in person doing  

451
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:24,160
it we would I would not be as you know animate or 
vocal as I am as when I'm there as an individual  

452
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:31,680
I'd be as a Committee Member as this Committee 
Member and be reflecting the the findings that  

453
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:39,240
are here in our report more than what I would 
be doing as an individual um then if there was  

454
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:45,800
any question and answer we could answer them as a 
group uh that's just kind of the way I feel about

455
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:55,240
it sounds like maybe be before our next quarterly 
we can do some research and present back just  

456
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:01,680
kind of how this works for other type of 
task force advisory committees um best

457
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:11,440
practices how's that sound I it's a great 
idea yeah I think that's a great idea and I  

458
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,560
would definitely appreciate your expertise in the 
political realm Dan in sort of figuring out how  

459
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:23,920
these sorts of things are normally conducted how 
we could schedule one um you sort of alluded to  

460
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:32,440
the challenges with a July timing for this sort of 
meeting um but we could start to plan it so we're  

461
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,720
ready um in terms of presenting some substantial 
recommendations hopefully with this next

462
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,360
report we'll do thank you Dan for

463
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:53,880
taking you had other thoughts so I guess yeah 
I guess that's maybe that's the end of this  

464
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:00,960
discussion unless anyone else wants to mention 
anything on just the the document we created  

465
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:10,640
what what we want to do with that instead of I 
mean if I'm being clear like last year's work  

466
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,520
what we want to do that compared to what we 
want to do this coming year is there any more  

467
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:23,880
discussion on ways we might want to report out on 
on the report itself or do we want to wait until  

468
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:29,480
we do some research and I have a question that's 
kind of related to that what you're saying but  

469
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:39,840
also the last Point like how do we learn what the 
feedback is if any to our report I mean I guess is  

470
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:45,600
that one of the things you're figuring out like 
because we make these recommendations and I yeah  

471
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:50,160
I realize some of them are there's nothing to go 
with but some of them you know we're saying like  

472
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:55,840
you should do a study you should do this and this 
and like how do we what is the process in which  

473
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:00,160
we find out they're like yeah no that's a great 
idea but we're not we don't have the money for  

474
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,720
this or we need more information about this like 
seems like and so I don't know if that's part of  

475
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:11,520
what you were going to be looking into or if not 
like maybe that's something that we can add to it  

476
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:18,280
right because like what yeah what were the what 
was the response to this you know was it like  

477
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,440
yeah and maybe it was just like nothing because 
there yeah they're like okay thanks but if it was  

478
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,720
like there was certain comments or criticisms 
or request for more information or guidance or  

479
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,240
whatever like that would be really helpful but so 
maybe that's Christina I guess that's a question  

480
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:39,280
for you you submitted the report did you get any 
feedback or do we do we know how we would hear  

481
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:46,080
any feedback I shared it with our legislative 
leis on um so I can ask her if there's like any  

482
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:53,240
process for that um but yeah she's the one that's 
directly in contact with those committees thank

483
00:49:53,240 --> 00:50:03,600
you she's going to ask the legislative Le 
person okay and then I guess along the line  

484
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:09,640
of procedures too I'd love to just have a little 
bit of discussion there was an email that kind of  

485
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:18,040
circulated for uh potentially bringing inviting 
Ally Hill to present and there was from what I  

486
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:27,840
recall a little um discussion on just process how 
we how we um how to we agree who we're going to  

487
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:34,240
bring in for presenting at meetings maybe open it 
up for discussion there if we're kind of setting  

488
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:40,520
up some procedures that we're all comfortable 
with to make sure that we're um working

489
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:46,960
together yeah that was my comment and I just 
thought we needed like a group consensus like  

490
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,400
we do like in our subcommittees just to make 
sure everyone was on board and I didn't know  

491
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:56,400
if we could do that via email which is why 
I suggest about it here but I don't know  

492
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:02,200
if I super formal it's like everyone agrees 
with it I think as long as everyone agrees  

493
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:09,000
on at this committee I think we're okay and it 
was Joe or gayen who sent the email right the  

494
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,200
original one was David I believe you suggested 
inviting her to the meeting but yeah I feel like  

495
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,840
we can't really do that in email because of 
the Sunshine Law like we have to have those

496
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:26,560
discussions here or like in a public 
forum and make those decisions

497
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:38,200
right is that right yes yes as long as but I mean 
if we have a public open Google Drive where we're  

498
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,960
setting an agenda couldn't somebody recommend 
inviting her and on the agenda we all accept the  

499
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:50,200
agenda but not the email yeah right yeah I think 
that's what you're talking about setting up a a  

500
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:59,040
formal public process for having those discussions 
yeah right so David you're the one who recommended  

501
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,360
Ali Hill initially did you want to talk a little 
bit about that and we can have that discussion  

502
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:12,080
here and then come to a consensus or I I would 
just argue back to the procedure topic that I  

503
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:20,760
don't think were prohibited from working outside 
of these meetings we if if we all said yeah okay  

504
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:30,720
let's let's hear from Ali Hill in an email let's 
invite her and we upload that that to the to the  

505
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:44,400
shared document we are right we are not restricted 
to only doing our work um once a month right we  

506
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:50,080
where there's no nowhere in the legislature law 
does it say you meet once a month we decided that  

507
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:57,520
we could meet once a year we could meet once a 
day we could meet once an hour uh we can email  

508
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:07,040
we can get together we just have to do it in front 
of the public and so um if if we want to hamstring  

509
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:15,520
ourselves and say well we'll only do anything 
when we're all here that that's a a procedural  

510
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:28,480
thing of our own choosing if I'm not mistaken um 
and and so be it um but um that that topic that  

511
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:38,880
that specific to Dan's let's talk about procedure 
I think we need to resolve before we talk about uh

512
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:50,520
Aly go ahead H yeah I was just gonna say 
that I agree with sort of your framing of  

513
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:58,400
the potential for emails for things like 
the invitations um I do think that would  

514
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:05,560
be easier to handle in a Google doc so that 
we can have some sort of confirmation from  

515
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:12,680
people um as we saw in response to your 
email not everyone responded um promptly  

516
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:19,640
or at all and so if we don't have a response 
from an email it's hard to confirm that sort  

517
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:26,120
of consensus that we were talking about but 
in general I do agree that we don't need to  

518
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:31,400
be fearful of sending emails to each other as 
long as we do document them all in a public

519
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:39,280
way so if we have a deadline 
of approving an agenda a week  

520
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,680
before the meeting and it's all 
on a Google Drive that's publicly

521
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:52,040
available I mean we can set that deadline and if 
we get five responses or seven responses that's  

522
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:57,600
the deadline so it's each person's responsibility 
if they want to weigh in to CU we can always  

523
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:04,000
abstain from voting in any you know during a 
meeting or any time so if we just kind of set up a  

524
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:13,440
process that we're building out the agenda and we 
and the everybody approves it the week beforehand  

525
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:19,480
and if somebody says Hey I want to invite X person 
to do this and we have a single person say I don't  

526
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,520
want them there then they just can't be on the 
agenda and we can have that discussion during  

527
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:30,920
the next meeting and Hammer it out does that 
seem fair as a process yeah that makes sense  

528
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:39,640
that that makes sense I I think the the thing 
that I was thinking about with in specifically  

529
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:49,320
regarding Ali Hill I was um remembering what we 
had come up with in our recommendation that like  

530
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:57,760
we would not specifically like we wouldn't um 
it said that we'll work collabor ly to evaluate  

531
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:04,080
potential partners and to come up to an agree with 
an agreement with what sources will be considered  

532
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:11,200
reliable and so I felt like that was jumping the 
gun by like inviting her to come present because  

533
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:18,040
we all hadn't talked and collaborated and agreed 
that she would be a an appropriate partner so I  

534
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:24,600
think it was it's the the substantive matter or 
that she was being invited for but I think you're  

535
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,640
right like if that's something that he puts on 
an agenda then I could say that right and so  

536
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,440
then we could talk about at the next meeting 
so I think process-wise I think you're what  

537
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:39,280
you're sugges makes sense but I just wanted to put 
that out there because we did make that agreement

538
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:54,320
earlier the the deadline to have a 
agenda did maybe I heard us talking  

539
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:58,880
about the agenda I didn't hear we had 
a deadline line is that a new thing or  

540
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:05,040
was that discussed we're proposing that 
David so that we do have a structure four  

541
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,760
agendas for both this committee and for the 
subcommittee so if we have a week before the  

542
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,880
meeting will be the deadline to submit 
items to the agenda on the on the share

543
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:22,600
drive and to contest anything on 
there a week before the meeting to  

544
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,160
add to the agenda and to contest anything yes okay

545
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,560
I guess we should put it out there how 
does everyone feel about that having a  

546
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:36,560
shared agenda and you have to the 
week before the meeting to add or  

547
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,400
contest anything on the agenda 
is everyone comfortable with

548
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:45,520
that yes I am at

549
00:57:45,520 --> 00:58:00,240
least Joe gayen David yes I'm comfortable with 
it and this is for all meetings for all meetings

550
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:11,080
yes David gayen are you okay 
with that or what are your

551
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:17,000
thoughts it works for

552
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,040
me the

553
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:37,560
uh I'm I'm just sorry I'm thaning through the 
right Aldo um you know we we don't have our  

554
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:44,160
other worker I guess Aldo does the best he can 
to get him here um adalo you know sometimes is  

555
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:49,720
there is he like we're we're we're kind of 
playing this in some ways it's a like they  

556
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:55,720
our own rules and we we decided to do this by 
consensus and that and now we're like well you  

557
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:02,160
know this guy and a week before and some people 
are engaged and you know well nobody answered  

558
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:10,240
the emails like I don't know maybe we're just 
getting too deep into the Weeds on some you  

559
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:16,560
know like we're we're trying to rewrite Robert's 
books of rules or something in like some kind of  

560
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:24,600
odd way and uh make make rules for ourselves 
that may maybe are going to get in our own way  

561
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:32,520
at some point but uh yeah take that for what 
it's worth I think it's it's just kind of a  

562
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:41,160
a silly thing to say that that's our Rule and 
right if you know if I the day before the day  

563
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:46,960
of the agenda I see something on the agenda 
and I say oh well I don't like that you know  

564
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:52,120
well you didn't say it a week before you know I 
and then I say well I don't like we shouldn't be  

565
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:57,360
doing this by consensus anymore we should you 
know change the structure and this should be  

566
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:03,480
done by like I don't I don't know what rights 
I have to do that we don't have like a bylaws  

567
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:13,560
like well I mean we just kind of get along 
and uh so it it seems somewhat silly to to  

568
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:19,000
kind of I call it hamstring ourselves but if 
that's what you guys want to do it's fine with

569
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:25,960
me do you have another suggestion

570
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:35,960
my my suggestion is what it was I you know last 
time and maybe even the time before I'm just so  

571
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:46,480
frustrated that we we have nothing to work 
with um and I think the only the only way to  

572
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:54,000
get around this is is I and I don't again politics 
are not my strong point but we need to have a bill  

573
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:02,920
written or the governor has to do something to 
change what we're doing here to make if if the  

574
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:09,480
legislature and the administration think what 
we're doing here is important they have to act  

575
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:20,480
and treat us like that and no offense to Christina 
or Aldo but like we we need facilitators we need  

576
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,320
uh somebody okay this is how we're going to 
operate and you know these are the members and  

577
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:30,760
we're going to use Robert's Book of Rules and 
we're gonna we're g to have resources and we  

578
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:36,360
heard you and you said you need data we're going 
to figure out how to get data and we're you know  

579
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:47,440
it it's kind of just like throw us in the room to 
make it look good you know um politically look we  

580
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:58,120
created this group but now we can ignore them we 
don't we don't need uh them and this I I've kind  

581
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:05,440
of talked around to to different people and it's 
a very very common situation what we are dealing  

582
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:14,640
with very very common for this type of thing 
to occur and appease of a societal you know  

583
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:22,360
political facade of look what we we care about 
get a bunch of people together and waste their  

584
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:28,240
time and then you know eventually we all get 
disinterested or fed up and quit or whatever  

585
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:35,760
and then and then it just kind of tapers off and 
and so I I'm really looking for that engagement  

586
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:43,160
from somebody where there's there's money 
there's uh facilitation and it takes all  

587
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:54,040
of this stuff that we're talking about and you 
know makes our work useful and and beneficial  

588
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:59,160
and and everybody knows that it's going to be be 
that at the end so that that's my suggestion but  

589
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:05,000
who who writes that bill or does the governor 
say I'm going to you know we're going to redo  

590
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:11,440
this or this is what I I don't know who and how 
that all happens but as of right now we don't  

591
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:19,120
we don't have the structure behind us the Mandate 
behind us to be able to work effectively my that's  

592
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:25,880
my I what I believe is the solution and with my 
lack of experience in politics is probably wrong

593
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:35,800
but Dave I served on on a local level for 
five years I also did work with the state  

594
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:42,920
legislature and your perception is 100% correct 
and I think I brought up similar concerns that  

595
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:50,720
the legislature say we did our job we're 
done um that is the way politics work and  

596
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:56,720
I don't care if you're talking about the town of 
Palisade Mesa County the state leg legislature on

597
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:07,360
up they tend to they tend to pass something pass 
it off to the legislative branch of government  

598
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:14,640
and ignore it after that so I understand your 
frustration and I'm happen I I'm very similar with  

599
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:19,360
David and being frustrated the way this was set 
up I'm still hopeful it can be changed to where  

600
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:25,720
it's a little more meaningful um I personally 
believe a lot of damage was done by this bill  

601
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:35,080
it was some good done too it would be nice to see 
it changed and to be something better um personal  

602
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:42,760
perception but if there's not a way to engage or 
if the different subcommittees that oversee this  

603
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:48,880
aren't interested then yeah we're wasting our 
time so David I do understand your frustration

604
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:58,200
completely well I think for the role of this  

605
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,800
committee with the authority 
we have through Senate Bill

606
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:06,360
2187 in a lot of

607
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:15,360
ways our best opportunity right now is to 
figure out ways that we can most effectively  

608
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:23,400
work especially within you know the Restraint 
of sunshine laws to as what they call gather and  

609
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:29,920
analyze data and other information regarding 
wages and working conditions of a workers um  

610
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:37,880
as effectively as possible and I I certainly 
understand the frustration of uh things around  

611
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:45,560
AG labor and the wheels of democracy in general 
um being somebody that works on it every day  

612
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:53,040
too uh but I think for today the best thing we 
can do is come up with some ways that we aren't  

613
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:58,720
hamstring ourselves and we aren't being efficient 
and maybe having a rule of one week ahead of time  

614
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:03,720
will slow us down but that's kind of I think the 
discussion at hand is how can we best fit within  

615
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:12,240
Sunshine laws and part of the where I was coming 
from with this was I felt a little um ignorant  

616
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:17,320
as far as what all we can do ahead of time and 
I want to make sure I'm living up to being the  

617
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:24,880
of responsibility for me being a coach a and 
then also how we kind of can build some work  

618
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:31,920
outside of our meetings that is compliant so maybe 
it's not a week ahead of time maybe it's two days  

619
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:38,440
ahead of time but I do think from what I remember 
we actually have to have this posted yes publicly  

620
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:45,000
before the meeting so we do have to set some 
type of deadline from what I understand of the

621
01:06:45,000 --> 01:07:03,440
rules so yeah maybe a week is two much 
is it though for inviting speakers yeah  

622
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:09,560
people's attendance that are you know 
coming I think if we cut it down it's  

623
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:13,120
just like have a hold on your calendar 
but maybe you're not going to come yeah  

624
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:20,120
that's true if this trly is bidding you know 
Sunshine as far as the public being able to  

625
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:24,640
see what we do there's no reason why we 
can't work off this document throughout  

626
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,320
the month right right in between meetings 
right as long as it's publicly available

627
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:43,200
so so okay so the is the The Proposal so there's 
a draft agenda out there or the the agenda for all  

628
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:53,400
meetings is out there the proposed agenda people 
can add to that agenda and then if if somebody  

629
01:07:53,400 --> 01:08:00,840
has suggests a topic for the agenda or a speaker 
for the agenda and another member of the committee  

630
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:07,920
does not agree with that they say that somehow 
on the agenda like as a comment yes and then  

631
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:15,440
when that happens if somebody is not in agreement 
with that particular to uh topic or speaker then  

632
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:23,120
that it doesn't necessarily become an agenda item 
like that it becomes an agenda item for discussion  

633
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:31,640
I guess right it or or it or it just doesn't make 
the agenda we can have a space in the agenda for  

634
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:36,840
contested agenda items and then talk about it at 
the meeting and then if there can be consensus  

635
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:41,480
for the next meeting then it makes it on the next 
agenda so obviously that that speaker wouldn't be  

636
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:46,360
invited to that meeting but the discussion of 
whether that's going to take place would have  

637
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:51,040
a place on the agenda it seems like yeah I mean 
maybe I guess you're right doesn't doesn't have  

638
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:56,920
to be because to me it allows some level of 
consensus without anybody totally trying to  

639
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:02,960
steer the you know the direction of the group 
based on our own personal point of view and  

640
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:15,760
it still allows for open discussion maybe it's 
a month delayed but okay yeah I think the goal  

641
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:21,520
is to set up that structure and that process for 
these meetings so I think that's that's fair what  

642
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:30,560
you're proposing and I will and David responding 
back to your thoughts too there's no reason why  

643
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:37,880
in this year's recommendations we can't say hey 
we believe that there needs to be a statutory  

644
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:44,880
chain to provide more support for this committee 
to do its work it doesn't it doesn't matter what  

645
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:51,720
we say in the report Dan nobody's reading it well 
that's what we're trying to figure out who cares  

646
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:59,520
what we write send them a blank piece of paper 
send them of the text of Crime and Punishment do  

647
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:10,720
right it doesn't matter what we say in the report 
it is not valued it is useless the time and money  

648
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:17,360
that we are all putting into this including our 
our taxpayers to have Christina sit here to have  

649
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:29,440
Aldo sit here to have Eric sit here is all wasted 
no one is using what we are doing here well I  

650
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:37,120
agree that it's only as valuable as how it is 
used this is a public document we do have the  

651
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:45,320
power to request a hearing that is something that 
we could request also this is a public document  

652
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:55,040
that can be used by anybody Farmers Union project 
protect cfga Joe citizen can use this to Advocate  

653
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:04,320
at the legislature to create change outside 
this committee and so that's where I guess  

654
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:10,480
you know hopefully that's not me but hopefully 
somebody can can do that right that's I guess  

655
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:18,840
that's you that's Rocky Mountain Farmers Union I 
don't know who that is but uh thanks for making  

656
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:28,600
me feel slightly better that it's not completely 
useless but it's only you know like 1% useful uh  

657
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:35,520
now you know I you you get my point like thank 
you you're you're right you know and you know  

658
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:43,600
we're doing good work we're trying but it it's 
just not it's not rewarding it's not you know  

659
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,560
we're not we've got to get somewhere and if 
if that means we got to go to Daniels and I  

660
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:54,680
remember you know talking with her about 2187 
and saying you know she's like well one day  

661
01:11:54,680 --> 01:12:00,160
maybe you'll need me and and I you know I don't 
really appreciate her and and but maybe I've got  

662
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:07,000
to go to her and say you know you we need this 
can you write this bill you know and i' I've  

663
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,040
been you know I've blame Senate leadership for 
the way they let it go and how you know and kind  

664
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:17,520
of where we are and I'm trying to think what do 
we do and how do we fix this and I'm with gayen  

665
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:27,440
like how can we get out of the Trap and into the 
to the you know something meaningful the drought  

666
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:36,760
task force I think is our Prime contemporary thing 
that we can use to show the the legislature the  

667
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:42,800
administration like look what you did there 
and look what you're doing here and there is  

668
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:50,320
legislation being written right now or proposed or 
whatever because of the work of the drought task

669
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:58,040
force there is none there is 
nothing going on because of what we

670
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:07,680
did nobody cared nobody said oh we got to get 
these people data can't do their work without

671
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:19,400
data well I appreciate you sharing 
your opinion because you're right  

672
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:27,920
I don't think any of us want to fall in the 
Trap of just spending what is it 24 hours a  

673
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:34,200
year together in addition to any side work 
and have it not go anywhere so I do agree  

674
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:40,200
that we do need to have discussions about how 
to make this an effective tool um across the

675
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:48,840
board David I hear you and I appreciate your 
position I think we've all been frustrated one  

676
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:53,400
time or another because I know even as co-chair 
I have to concur with what Dan said earlier as a  

677
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:58,000
co-chair and not having with the restrictions 
of the Sunshine Law we're having to maneuver  

678
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:04,640
around that and it's been it's been a challenge 
and um I'll accept that on for on my behalf but  

679
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:10,200
I think moving forward given the time it's 11:19 I 
think we should probably talk about you brought up  

680
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:16,080
Ali Hill I would think this is the perfect time 
we did request for additional data let's start  

681
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:24,080
asking those presenters to come and meet with this 
committee and share information um that was one of  

682
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:31,280
the recommendations that we have speakers we have 
to we have to agree that that they're credible or  

683
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:36,840
that we're all comfortable with that David you 
brought Ali Hill and I think Joe you also you  

684
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:47,360
also advocated to have her come and present to 
this group correct Joe yes I did and uh I agree  

685
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:53,920
uh with all that you know Rome wasn't built in a 
day drought data is you've had you know 10 to 20  

686
01:14:53,920 --> 01:15:00,640
years worth of data we don't have any and as time 
goes along and data starts coming in and and this  

687
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:09,160
thing starts to come together I think uh we have 
to be a little more patient um uh just the way  

688
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:15,840
I kind of feel about it but yeah I'm up for Ali 
Hill and uh whoever else may come in uh whether  

689
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:21,920
whether whatever Viewpoint or expert we can get 
uh to supply data and as time goes on we'll put  

690
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:28,760
that together and hopefully be able to relay that 
in person to the ACT committee which Danielson  

691
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:37,480
sits on and um maybe we can make a difference that 
way I also agree with Dan on the public comment I  

692
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:45,560
know uh a lot of uh producers uh paid attention 
to uh what was put out in the C cfga newsletter  

693
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:50,200
uh it wasn't much but there was a link to the 
document and I know a lot of people read it  

694
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:57,640
so uh on either side or whatever side there there 
might be out there so I think information of what  

695
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:02,840
we're doing here is is uh getting out there and 
uh we've been able to build some bridges here and  

696
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:10,840
that uh to me speaks uh miles uh in progress uh 
compared to where we were before it all started  

697
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:16,720
uh and where we are now personally I think uh 
I feel a lot better about it I'm glad to be

698
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:29,560
here so can we get consensus that we would like 
at Ali Hill at our next meeting and then maybe  

699
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:36,000
down the road have another presenter come 
to provide information and the reason I'm  

700
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,400
saying that is so that we can get her on the 
agenda and someone can reach out and invite  

701
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:44,280
her for our next meeting but let's have 
that discussion I am certainly in favor  

702
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:51,320
of inviting her um she's solid academic 
record um I reached out to her about the  

703
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:57,040
study already and she was at least willing 
to answer some of my probing questions um  

704
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:01,920
but I think it would be good to have her at a 
meeting so we can really discuss everything in

705
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:12,560
detail you comment um well if we're gonna invite 
somebody with um with that type of background I  

706
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:18,960
mean I would rather invite Phil Martin who's um 
has way more experience than Ali Hill in this  

707
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:27,840
area um but I I mean I guess either one is fine 
I'm just trying to confirm whether are we talking  

708
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:36,160
about at the next quarterly the meeting as a 
whole like this entire group or because that  

709
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:40,680
particular study was talking about the wages 
right that study was I mean I know she's done  

710
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:50,120
other studies and looked into other other issues 
but and as Phil Martin as well um and so I would  

711
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:56,080
suggest Phil Martin but I would also wanted 
to clarify like what we inviting them to talk  

712
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:00,640
about because they do have they look at a lot 
of different things so if we're talking labor  

713
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:05,640
conditions we're talking wages then maybe it 
should be to that particular subcommittee can  

714
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:18,320
we do both inite both of them this isn't an either 
or Jennifer by any means and and uh I feel like um  

715
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:25,080
I I I see this happen with uh politics like where 
the president can't meet with somebody because  

716
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:33,920
it might look bad or whatever um my take is is 
invite you know without wasting all of our time  

717
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:44,640
but invite everyone and let's build relationship 
Rapport Bridges whatever you will um I don't know  

718
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:52,800
who Phil Martin is but sounds like I need to no I 
mean he's her predecessor I think he's her Mentor  

719
01:18:52,800 --> 01:19:03,680
I think he trained her you know is is what I'm 
looking for is Ally can you help our committee  

720
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:11,960
understand better how to fill the holes can we 
work with you are you um able to help us answer  

721
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:19,360
questions and and get her in front of everyone 
so everyone can say well I don't trust her or  

722
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:25,280
even if she does get us an answer it's no good um 
and the same thing would be with with Phil Martin  

723
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:35,240
or anyone but the the the idea is to get them 
here and hear them out listen to them and see  

724
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:44,240
what they're they're able to offer us Ali Hill may 
not come like we it's great to say oh yeah doesn't  

725
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:53,120
mean she has time or she cares or feel the same 
thing or anyone but um I in my mind I like what's  

726
01:19:53,120 --> 01:20:02,800
it hurt to to have her come talk about her a labor 
statistic uh California thing that we all talked  

727
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:12,480
about and get a better understanding of what it 
what it can mean or what it can't mean Etc we  

728
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:17,880
don't have to put that in our report right that I 
don't think just because she came to a Mee doesn't  

729
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:24,840
mean Ali Hill reported that workers are getting 
their wages cut you know in California and that's  

730
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:30,320
what you know that like we don't I don't think we 
have to be scared of something like that it's just  

731
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:38,760
simple information gathering Rapport building and 
right yeah no I'm just trying to I think we need  

732
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:46,000
to clarify what the ask is because they they do a 
lot and so that's why I was trying to confirm for  

733
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:51,560
myself are we asking them to come to this meeting 
as a whole like when this this group meets us  

734
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:57,720
these quarterly meetings or the subcommittees and 
and what are we asking them to come to talk about  

735
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:02,640
is it like California so that's what I think we 
need to we need to all be on the same page about  

736
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:10,920
before we ask oh I don't know if it seems like 
it'd be the same for committee or uh subcommittee  

737
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:16,800
uh either one I mean we always discuss the same 
things anyway at either one so and we're all there  

738
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:24,200
so might as well just let's do it you know ASAP 
so we get the ball rolling a little bit faster  

739
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:31,200
I supp but I'd be willing to hear from both of 
them I would propose that we invite Ali to speak  

740
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:41,520
specifically to that report that she released 
as far as overtime pay impacts across the a  

741
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:48,000
industry in California and then any other Insight 
that she can provide as far as potential overtime  

742
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:55,800
impacts to the a sector in Colorado and that's 
impact to workers and employers and competition  

743
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:01,480
between states and everything else that they 
might be able to provide and if Phil has Insight  

744
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:08,520
I absolutely support even broadening it since it 
sounds like he has a more established breath of

745
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:18,960
research so what if we had Ally at the wage 
subcommittee and then had bill at the or we  

746
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:24,240
invite both I mean they're both really busy 
neither of them are focused in Colorado anymore  

747
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:29,720
I mean I know Ali worked really closely with 
Adrien card for a while um but I know I don't  

748
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:35,560
think she's in Colorado anymore and so we could 
invite both and see which one of them comes or I  

749
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:41,000
mean I think I agree I think it makes sense to 
just invite them to the to the meeting to the  

750
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:49,240
group as a whole that to get a sense of what kind 
of data they do have access to and to ask those  

751
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:54,560
questions of them I mean they're economists 
right and so I think that we could ask those  

752
01:22:54,560 --> 01:23:02,360
questions to either one of them and that cover 
kind of all of our the labor conditions and wage  

753
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:06,320
stuff and then they can kind of let us know what 
they have okay and letting them know right the  

754
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:12,880
the the reason I think we're inviting them is 
like prompted it was this the the articles that  

755
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:22,360
they've been doing on overtime but I'm sure that 
they have other information to share I would um  

756
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:34,440
say that we we may have to um it work around 
their schedules if we care um or you know if  

757
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:41,800
we're we're desperate um they you know they may 
not fit our scheduling and if we value what they  

758
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:47,840
have to say and want to hear them we might have to 
have another meeting or or allow them to say well  

759
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:54,800
this is when I'm available and I'd be happy to 
meet with your group and and get that set up and  

760
01:23:54,800 --> 01:24:06,160
maybe make it an extra meeting um outside of our 
kind of standing meetings um Andor be nimble in in  

761
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:17,880
the the committee split meetings to maybe uh say 
okay we're gonna have some invitees th this day  

762
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:23,400
and we're gonna take the first 20 or 30 minutes 
and so instead of having an hour each committee it  

763
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:35,040
turns into 40 minutes each committee um with a you 
know 40 minutes in the beginning for something but

764
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:46,280
uh so we heard about inviting both Bill and 
Ally to either subcommittee or a the full board  

765
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:53,640
committee is everybody okay with with inviting 
both I mean I think it's a great idea yeah to be  

766
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:58,320
clear I was just saying invite both to see if if 
one or the other could come but not both of them  

767
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:02,960
at the same time because well I mean I don't 
I I just because Phil's like the guru of like  

768
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:08,320
ad labor economics like that's my understanding 
right and Ally I think is is newer and she worked  

769
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:13,560
under him or she studied under him and so I was 
saying you know he may not be available but she  

770
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:18,560
might be or vice versa but but that's that was 
the reason I was throwing it out there because  

771
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:24,320
of their schedules and because we have these 
time frames but but yeah I mean maybe they're um

772
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:31,760
I don't know if we need them both I think 
we probably just need one of them but

773
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:42,600
um but the chances of getting one of them 
might be better we just survive both so well  

774
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:48,760
here's the thing that bothers me alli's study 
is an actual study done through very credible  

775
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:55,440
definitely not right-wing definitely leftwing 
School of economics in California and yet she  

776
01:25:55,440 --> 01:26:01,080
still came up with results she came up with I 
don't know if Phil's currently doing any actual  

777
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:09,160
research on the on the modern condition that's 
going on I don't know that he isn't either um  

778
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:16,640
I'd rather hear about an actual study then I 
would hear about an opinion that is based on  

779
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:21,280
something that wasn't tried until recently I also 
know there's studies going on in Oregon there's  

780
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:25,400
study going on in Washington and one in New York 
that I don't know when they'll come out or if they  

781
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:32,840
ever do come out Washington has a nasty habit of 
squashing things they don't like what they say um  

782
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:42,000
I would prefer Ali that's an actual study and it's 
pray reviewed it's published it's not an opinion  

783
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:49,680
let me put it to you that way it's an actual study 
it has more validity in my mind and I don't know  

784
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:54,320
anything about Phil but I haven't seen anything 
come I've seen Ali study come across peer review  

785
01:26:54,320 --> 01:27:02,480
haven't seen anything about Phil ever come across 
in peer review so I that's my concern I still it  

786
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:06,840
might be great to have him come he probably has 
Insight that I don't have I think we ought to have

787
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:29,080
both what if we invite them we give we 
send an invitation to both Ally and to  

788
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:33,320
Phil and give them the three dates of 
our regular subcommittee meetings and  

789
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:39,440
our schol board meeting to see what 
date they're available and then we  

790
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:43,520
could accommodate their schedule with those 
that would be my recommendation see who's

791
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:52,480
available yeah yeah yeah if if we need 
to set a special meeting based on their  

792
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:56,600
schedule we'll work together and figure 
out a time and I think they work closely  

793
01:27:56,600 --> 01:28:00,240
enough together that they'll probably decide 
like figure out like who schedule or who's  

794
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:05,840
best to speak on it too you know who has more 
relevant current knowledge or whatever so we  

795
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:11,160
all have to be in agreement is everybody 
online okay with that proposal yes from

796
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:19,360
Hunter yes who's going to do that the 
committee chairs or who's going to contact

797
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:30,520
him Hunter you're always our Workhorse since 
you've been in touch I I I'm happy yeah I can  

798
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:37,960
reach out to them um thank you you have the I was 
gonna I was gonna I mean I could too because I've  

799
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:44,080
been in touch with Phil Martin and her but if 
you want yeah I certainly don't want to and I  

800
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:50,680
would be sort of cold calling Phil so if you 
have a relationship with him that works well  

801
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:55,760
for me that well there you go but unless she 
come from the chairs though like you're the  

802
01:28:55,760 --> 01:29:01,560
chair of a committee it's to the it's to the 
full committee meeting right either whatever  

803
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:07,160
they're available okay so Jennifer will 
take on that thank you y we got something

804
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:19,960
accomplish I I suppose Jennifer has to upload her 
email to the thing so she to them and say we want  

805
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:26,760
you to come be on this committee and she's doing 
the work of the committee and that's all subject  

806
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:32,080
to how do I do that she from what I understand she 
only needs to if she's including another Committee  

807
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:38,040
Member yeah she can do any independent work 
well she's doing the work of the committee right  

808
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:43,480
yeah it's about communication between community 
members so yeah agreed and it's also logistical  

809
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:48,240
so I wouldn't see a need to here okay well if 
you guys want I can do that I can put my email  

810
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:54,600
and her their response yeah I mean that's fine I 
don't think it's required yeah don't need I I'm  

811
01:29:54,600 --> 01:30:00,840
looking to kind of understand these rules better 
and so if if that's out that's great thank you

812
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:07,360
Christina not necessary for 
me to be clear like I'm not  

813
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,960
I'm fine with it not if if it doesn't have to

814
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:13,800
be do

815
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:24,520
we that covers speak for the next meeting 
is there anything else I I think we covered  

816
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:28,280
everything on our agenda we do have at least 
a speaker for the next one hopefully for the  

817
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:33,640
next meeting anything else any any anyone 
would like to cover before we adjourn

818
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:43,640
today I think my hope is that over the next 
three weeks we will each individually kind  

819
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:52,280
of look at the recommendations we brought 
forward last year and populate um the draft  

820
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:58,120
agendas um for for things that can 
be discussed during the subcommittee  

821
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:06,080
meetings um I would like us to continue 
to look at the fair food program I don't  

822
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:14,480
know if we can invite somebody from 
there to talk a little bit uh at some

823
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:23,920
point do you think that would be more appropriate 
for working conditions wages for full committee  

824
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:33,240
man they kind of cover everything uh 
yeah I I just think it is good for all  

825
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:44,520
of the people here to get exposed to the work 
they're doing and um I get my thought is um

826
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:58,600
that my farm is a fair foods uh certified 
farm and uh uh as it relates to wages and  

827
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:06,360
working conditions on farms they're coming 
and interviewing is a rigorous process that  

828
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:17,800
is designed to eliminate coerced responses 
and ensure that worker voices are being  

829
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:24,760
they're they're authentic and they're real 
which is a big concern of this um group of  

830
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:32,760
the the situation and so it's a in my mind 
it it I perceive it as a silver bullet for  

831
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:43,800
producers and labor Advocates to um have Real 
Results um in in improving conditions where  

832
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:53,680
abuses are happening and giving um you know the 
producers who are are good producers the p on  

833
01:32:53,680 --> 01:33:01,640
the the back and the clout that they deserve to 
be recognized as good employers um and and so I

834
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:12,160
think if we could if we could dig into that you 
know maybe our committee would would recommend  

835
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:16,960
the state look into something or you know 
I don't know what where it could lead but  

836
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:31,320
I I I am a believer that it's a um a way to avoid 
nasty policy legislation things yet have positive  

837
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:41,960
impacts on worker conditions so David I think 
i' probably propose we kind of follow the same  

838
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:49,360
line of thinking we did with Ally and Phil is 
we would invite somebody from the organization  

839
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:55,880
it probably either be judge Laura Greg asbed 
or the person the they've hired for Colorado  

840
01:33:55,880 --> 01:34:03,640
I'm assuming and let them choose who they feel 
would be the best representative um would we  

841
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:12,000
want to try to put that in the next subcommittee 
meeting or would we want to put that in the next  

842
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:20,760
full committee meeting in three months or do 
we just do Betty three dates and navigate it  

843
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:27,200
you you're the masters of the agenda the sooner 
the better for me right we I mean there's a lot  

844
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:33,120
of work to be done the sooner the better I think 
it's important I think it's a you know but but  

845
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:39,120

849
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:04,760
verification process that David described

856
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:51,720
the farm labor stabilization pilot program that 
was recently released and I I'm currently still  

857
01:35:51,720 --> 01:36:01,160
looking for potential a representative from 
uh a worker Union if anybody has any contacts  

858
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:07,000

um if it's either somebody from flock or from  

859
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,680
United Farm Workers um would be I would love 
to be in touch with them to kind of round out a

860
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:25,840
panel I wish I could help but I don't have any 
contacts with those folks sure yeah I mean I just  

861
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:31,840
have flocker you but and I might reach out I don't 
think there's anybody else either and I know it's  

862
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:36,840
not a workers but there's probably connections 
with you United commercial food workers as well  

863
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:43,200
as aflc you know they're all kind of in the same 
famili so yeah right guess jobs Justice jobs with  

864
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:53,520
Justice probably maybe yeah what was his name 
jobs with Justice oh job of Justice yeah Sophia

865
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:04,280
thank
you does anybody else have anything else for for

866
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:13,640
today I just want to note that I made the draft 
agendas for the next two subcomittee sets of  

867
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:19,800
subcommittee meetings and the full advisory 
committee meeting so if anybody wants to add  

868
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:26,280
anything or any suggestions those are available 
in the this folder already thank you Hunter for  

869
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:32,520
doing that um I just wanted to know um I know was 
not here today so maybe today's not the best day  

870
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:37,840
for this conversation but um facilitating our 
meetings to be mindful of The Interpreter and  

871
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:43,920
allowing for um like valuable participation in 
Spanish just because I think we go really quickly  

872
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:48,680
and I'm also guilty of this um so just something 
to know and maybe we can check in with other if  

873
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:55,360
we can make it next meeting okay well yeah and 
I I wonder also if that's maybe I have no idea  

874
01:37:55,360 --> 01:38:02,160
but like I'm wondering is is that maybe a reason 
why yeah it's like yeah he has ad minutes is as  

875
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:08,600
president you know he's pretty vocal because yeah 
I know him separately and he's very vocal right  

876
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:14,560
and so I I I wonder if yeah if there's a reason 
like the lack of being able to fully participate  

877
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:24,640
has impacted his um just prioritization yeah of 
these meetings as you know seeing it as being  

878
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:33,520
important enough for where he has a voice so 
it could be like that whole circular problem  

879
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:38,520
thank you for that reminder we'll be mindful 
good point I'm G to reach out to him too wait  

880
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:44,440
can I I can reach out to him about logistics 
about coming I think so right okay Logistics

881
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:53,440
